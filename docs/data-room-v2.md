# Tempo Data Room v2 — generation report

Generated: 2026-08-31 (template-density guardrail + rewritten filler fact pools)  
Simulation ID: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002` (Sell Tempo to Summit Dental Group)

## What changed

- **2026-08-31 (this run):** Removed single-frame supplemental facts (`"Local coverage noted the … in the Mountain West region."`). Replaced with 33 hand-written facts per vertical (varied structure, subject, and length). Added generic `validateNoTemplateDensity` alongside the existing anti-correlation validator. Trap disqualifier insert index now biases toward the middle and end of the array.
- **2026-08-31 (prior):** Universal `research_facts` range 4–7; `validateNoStructuralClassCorrelation`; unique trap disqualifiers; vertical fact/signal pools.

## Template-density guardrail (generic, reusable)

`validateNoTemplateDensity(records, config)` in `scripts/generate-prospect-directory.ts` is **simulation-agnostic**. Field definitions live in `templateDensity` in `tempo-directory-seed.ts`.

**Skeleton algorithm:** lowercase, strip punctuation, keep first three and last three tokens (`toSentenceSkeleton`).

**Per-record failures:**

| Condition | When it throws |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Template density** | More than 2 strings in one record share a skeleton |
| **Odd-one-out** | 3+ strings share one skeleton and exactly one string is structurally distinct |

**Corpus failure:** any skeleton accounts for more than 15% of all strings in a configured field.

Runs in the same pre-insert pass as `validateNoStructuralClassCorrelation`; neither replaces the other.

### Validator proof (forced leaks)

| Test | Exact error |
|------|-------------|
| 3 templated facts (old frame) in one record | `Template density: record "Rainier Vision Group" has 3 strings sharing skeleton "local coverage noted in the region" in field "facts" (max 2)` |
| 3 templated + 1 distinct (odd-one-out) | `Template odd-one-out: record "Rainier Vision Group" has 3+ strings sharing skeleton "local coverage noted in the region" and one structurally distinct string in field "facts": "Practice-wide vendor selection for appointment software finished last quarter."` |

### Corpus skeleton stats (2026-08-31 run)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total research fact strings | 349 |
| Most common skeleton | `indeed post seeks for evening shifts` |
| Corpus share | **0.9%** (well under 15% cap) |
| Facts containing `"in the Mountain West region"` | **0** |

## Anti-correlation guardrail (unchanged)

`validateNoStructuralClassCorrelation` still runs before insert. Production roster passes with every class spanning fact counts 4, 5, 6, and 7.

## research_facts distribution (2026-08-31 run)

| class | facts=4 | facts=5 | facts=6 | facts=7 |
|-------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| `strong_fit` | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| `near_miss` | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| `trap` | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| `pass` | 8 | 8 | 8 | 8 |
