export const TEMPO_ICP_CRITERIA = `
    A correct ICP for Tempo should identify:
    - Multi-location, appointment-based service businesses (dental,
      veterinary, physical therapy, optometry, med spa, chiropractic,
      or similar)
    - Enough scale that manual scheduling coordination genuinely breaks
      down (not a single-location shop where phone scheduling is still
      manageable)
    - Currently scheduling manually/by phone — NOT already using a
      competitor's tool with no complaints
    - Experiencing real, current operational strain or growth pressure —
      not steady-state, comfortable operations
    - A buyer with real authority over operations/tooling decisions —
      not just whoever happens to answer the phone

    Common WRONG patterns to catch:
    - Too generic ("any healthcare business") with no real filtering logic
    - Focused on company size/prestige rather than actual pain signals
    - Misses the "currently manual scheduling" requirement
    - Misses the "real trigger/strain happening now" requirement

export const TEMPO_ICP_CORRECTED_TEXT =

  "appointment-based businesses — think dental, vet, physical " +
  "therapy, that kind of thing — where scheduling is still manual, " +
  "and where something recent is putting real strain on operations. " +
  "A company that's comfortable and stable isn't your target. A " +
  "company that's stretched right now is.";

export const TEMPO_ICP_AFFIRMED_TEXT =
  "That's a solid filter — you're thinking about the right signals. " +
